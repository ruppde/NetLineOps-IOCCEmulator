Work in progress of a backend that emulates a NetLine/Ops server in order to render a Gantt on a decompiled ExtJS frontend that generates a Gantt diagram. My managers many years ago used this software back then, I always found it interesting and decided to try to replicate it, nothing personal, I'm just bored sitting 8 hours a day in an open space.

Big work in progress, ActiveMQ messaging doesn't work at all, there's many hacks and workarounds, not to mention most of the data being hardcoded fake because how else would I be supposed to get information such as ACARS?

## Installation
I'm not going to provide any information regardign compilation or anything, the source code is somewhat awful but if you really want to get it running it shouldn't be that much of a problem. Read the source and try to figure out.
